Hi there!

I'm Harvey. Welcome to my first blog space!  

### About this blog
This blog started at the beginning of summer 2017, when I started working towards the next target in my life: a PhD in Computer Science about applying state-of-art AI tech to real life tasks.

You see, I have an ambition to create products that can change people's life by changing their way of interaction with life. Something like a trash can in the kitchen that automatically pops out when you want to throw a messy pile of lobster shells on your chopping board with both of your hands occupied. A life where things around really understands people.

That sounds far away.
But far enough to be an ambition.

Oh right, about this blog.
I have a long way to go and a whole lot to learn to even start a PhD.  
So I decided to start this blog as a great way to:
1. Share my learning process with people who care enough to pop by this page
2. Organize my thoughts, cool ideas, stupid ideas
3. Store useful knowledge that I don't want to forget


### A bit of technical details of this blog
I'm still very new to blogging, so I'd like to keep things simple for now.
I'll work on more fancy blogging as I learn more about the building process, JekyII and HTML.
For now, this blog is managed via a GitHub repo and served by [*GitHub Pages*](https://pages.github.com) using the static site generator [*JekyII*](https://jekyllrb.com).
